                <div className='welcome-text'>Greetings from the Training & Placement (T&P) Office, National Institute of Technology Mizoram (NIT Mizoram), an Institution of National Importance under the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India!
                    Being one of the premier institutes of the country, NIT Mizoram, under the Directorship of Prof. S. Sundar, is working determinedly to impart quality education to its BTech, MTech, and Ph.D. courses in engineering and sciences that keep pace with the latest advances in research and development activities and committed to serving the societal and industrial needs of the country. The institute is situated in the scenic beauty of Mizoram, wrapped between clouds and mountains.
                    The T&P Office, NIT Mizoram, facilitates the placement process of students passing out from the Institute, besides collaborating with leading organizations and institutes to set up student internship and training programs. The office liaises with various industrial establishments, corporate houses, etc., which conduct campus interviews and select graduate and post-graduate students from all disciplines. Besides catering to other logistics, the T&P Office provides infrastructural facilities to conduct group discussions, tests, and interviews. The office makes every effort each day to bridge the gap between the dreams and capabilities of our students through training programs to enhance the soft skills and overall personality of students in association with industry and academic experts.
                    The placement season runs throughout the year, from July through to June. Pre-placement talks are also conducted in this regard as per mutual convenience between the industries and the institute. Job offers, dates of interviews, selection of candidates, etc., are announced through the T&P Office. The Placement Office is assisted by a Faculty T&P Committee comprising faculty members from each department. Student coordinators and members from various undergraduate and post-graduate engineering streams support the office via core, executive, and associate team members. The committee evolves a broad policy framework yearly besides a set of inviolable rules. Student coordinators and members are closely co-opted in implementing these policy decisions.
                    I am confident that our students will prove themselves and contribute immensely toward pursuing the organizationâ€™s ambitions with a ray of hope that our indigenous and global industries will offer internships and jobs to our students at our campus. Further, this relationship will go beyond other engagements and mutual benefits. I sincerely appreciate our industry partners who have recognized the depth of our rich and diverse talent pool and accorded valuable opportunities.
                    More information about the institute and various courses offered to the students is available in the placement brochure. Please feel free to contact the T&P Office, NIT Mizoram, in case of any queries at tnp@nitmz.ac.in.
                    I look forward to a fruitful and mutually beneficial relationship with your esteemed organization.</div>
